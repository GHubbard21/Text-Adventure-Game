My Text Advenure Project is a simple game
where the player wakes  up hungover and hungry, unaware
of their actions from the night before.
The player is left a note by a roommate and is sent on a mission to find locate their phone and piece together
the phone number for the local pizza place. 

The player wakes up in their room and has the abilty to move between rooms in their apartment. The player must find a key and their phone in order to get all pieces of the phone number and finally call the pizza place. 

The 3 parts of the phone number are located in the player's
bathroom, the kitchen and in the hallway.
The key in order to get into the player's bedroom is in your 
roommate, Zack's bathroom. 
After "Getting" the key and "Grabbing the phone" the player
can make their way to their bathroom where they can call the
pizza place and place their order.
